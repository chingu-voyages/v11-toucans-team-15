## History Behind the name

Colma is a combination of the two (2) developers of this theme

- **Col**lins E.
- **Ma**ina N.

## Voyage History

To be able to push a learning and interactive process. The authors decided to
 pursue a full digital agency setup both in the making of it and also in the implementation.

This project is not only of a digital agency but has been made by one (at least in concept).
Over the 6 sprint voyage. The team first created an ideation workshop, which also included:

- Coming up with the style guide of the proposed agency.
- Low level prototype of the template. Tool used: Balsamiq
- Designs of the template. Tools used: Adobe Creative Suite
- Back and forth dev implementation & monitoring using ZenHub.

We hope it was a success to all involved.

## Development

In order to get this template running on your local machine. There are several items you need prior:

- Node & a "package manager" - we went with npm
- an IDE

To start the dev server. All you need to enter in your command line is:

```sh
npm start
```

This should insatll all the dependencies we are using as we develop the template.
